# StickSMash Expo Tutorial project

This is my interpretation of the expo tutorial project, the application allows users add images from their device and attach stickers to these images.

I have followed through the tutorial and made a few changes I believe are reasonable.

## Running the project

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
